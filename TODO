REPL with readline library. Also evaluate after enter, not ctrl-d.

Exit functionality.

Proper tests in test directory (remove check directory). Run tests as make check.

Parser:
Dont't allocate and deallocate each string token.
Use #define SAVE_TOKEN_STRING (yylval->sVal = yytext)

Create parser_info structure in node.h.
Use it to pass filename, line, and column information.
Use @$.first_line, @$.first_column in yacc and
YY_USER_ACTION instead of line. Look to ID2202 voluntary labs.

Comment and refactor if necessary all except
kiss.l, kiss.y

Use md files for documentation

Add flex, bison dependencies to doc.
Seperate the detailed documentation from README

Configure readline.

Long term objectives:
Compiler
OOP 
Exception handling
Stream programming
