Implement the whole interpreter in c++

Operation between different type of values. int+rational=rational, number+string=string, ...

Recursively delete nodes after evaluating the program. main.c and node.c.

Find a way to deallocate values. Maybe garbage collecting from lonely frames. 

Implement rational numbers. 

Array literal (Equivalent of in C "{1, 2, 3}")



Later:

valueof/k (using continuations)

C like structures. (maybe a mapping like data structure)

OOP 

exception handling


Maybe:

New implementation for Integer that supports integers larger than 4 byte.
