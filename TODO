For loop

binary and hexadecimal numbers

casting

Recursively delete nodes after evaluating the program. main.c and node.c.

Find a way to deallocate values. Maybe garbage collecting from lonely frames. 

Implement +=, ++, etc.

Implement rational numbers, and strings. 

Array literal (Equivalent of in C "{1, 2, 3}")

Operation between different type of values. int+rational=rational, number+string=string, ...

makefile bug: after cleaned, it does not see c output of yacc and lex.

Implement better error checking and reporting for lex, yacc, and interpreter.


Later:

valueof/k (using continuations)

C like structures. (maybe a mapping like data structure)

OOP 

exception handling


Maybe:

New implementation for Integer that supports integers larger than 4 byte.
