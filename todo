Command-line argument, start repl with file.

Implement gensym.

Implement list functions in base or stdlib.

Composit type in base library. Like structure.
def create_file = [composite :file [list :filename
                                         :file_id]]
def create_file = [composite :file [list [cons :filename :string]
                                         [cons :file_id :integer]]]
returns a procedure that creates the composit type.

def my_file = [create_file ]
[field my_file ...] gets the field
[typeof my_file] returns :type_name etc.

[__system_feature__ ] for calling functions like write, read, open ...

Implement stack trace (actually track which nodes are being
aveluating. Each node should push itself to a stack when
evaluating. And when throwing exception, this stack can be moved to
cache statement.

Proper tests in test directory (remove check directory). Run tests as make check.

Parser:
Dont't allocate and deallocate each string token.
Use #define SAVE_TOKEN_STRING (yylval->sVal = yytext)

Create parser_info structure rather then filename and line in node.h.
Use it to pass filename, line, and column information.
Use @$.first_line, @$.first_column in yacc and
YY_USER_ACTION instead of line. Look to ID2202 voluntary labs.

Use md files for documentation

Add flex, bison, readline dependencies to doc.
Seperate the detailed documentation from README

Configure readline.

Stream programming in the standard library. 

Implement types in the standard library.

Try and cache blocks using try and cache in the background.

Long term objectives:
Compiler
OOP
