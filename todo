Priority:
Now __array_get|set__ is for arrays and strings. Separate them, update the documentation.

Write top documentation file. Revise core documentation and link them.


Implement function call trace. Function calls can implement try catch
block. Better try-catch nesting in general.

Proper tests in test directory. Run tests as make check.

Core:
[__system_feature__ ] for calling functions like write, read,
open, close (for now only these to enable printing to stdout and file,
scanning from them).

Configure readline.

Base:
Composit types. May implement by warpping type.lmn

Stdlib:
Implement list functions in base or stdlib.
Stream programming.

Docs:
Write core language documentation after some while.

Find a way for inline documentation. 

Deside later:
String built in. Creating...

Create parser_info structure rather then filename and line in node.h.
Use it to pass filename, line, and column information.

Parser bugs:
// Comment does not work when not followed by a new line.

Block comments don't count line number.

Dont't allocate and deallocate each string token.
Use #define SAVE_TOKEN_STRING (yylval->sVal = yytext)

Use @$.first_line, @$.first_column in yacc and
YY_USER_ACTION instead of line. Look to ID2202 voluntary labs.


Long term objectives:
Compiler
OOP
