Priority:
Proper tests in test directory. Run tests as make check.
Generate reference test file that will be compared "diff" with
the current test outputs. 

Make empty array available.

Core:
printing chars to repl without [print] should print the symbol of
char, not itself. '\n' should print '\n', not newline.

Commandline arguments.

printAST commandline argument.

Implement function call trace. Function calls can implement try catch
block. Better try-catch nesting in general.

[__system_feature__ ] for calling functions like write, read,
open, close (for now only these to enable printing to stdout and file,
scanning from them).

Configure readline.

Base:
Composit types. May implement by warpping type.lmn

cons cells with types. custom printing for cells.

map and amap and smap function in base.  (for cons cells and arrays
and strings) And another iteration function that does not create the
second structure and returns a single value. (a practical version of
while loop)

Stdlib:
Implement list functions in base or stdlib.


Docs:
Docs for base and stdlib.

Deside later:
String built in. Creating...

Create parser_info structure rather then filename and line in node.h.
Use it to pass filename, line, and column information.

Parser bugs:
// Comment does not work when not followed by a new line.

Block comments don't count line number.

Dont't allocate and deallocate each string token.
Use #define SAVE_TOKEN_STRING (yylval->sVal = yytext)

Use @$.first_line, @$.first_column in yacc and
YY_USER_ACTION instead of line. Look to ID2202 voluntary labs.


Long term objectives:
Stream programming.
Find a way for inline documentation. 
Tail call optimization. (maybe with continuation passing style)

Very long term objectives:
Compiler
OOP
