# Strings

There is no built-in string value in Limon. Strings are implemented as
array of characters. That's why, manipulation of strings is achieved
by procedure specially implemented for strings, such as `print_str` and
`is_string`. 

Procedures manipulating strings are implemented in the Base
library. In `string.lmn`.
